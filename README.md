# Java-CommandLine-LoginSystem
## The project involves creating a database schema to store user information and configuring the JDBC driver to connect to the database. The system should be able to handle multiple users, secure password storage, and user authentication with session management.

**Some additional features that can be added to the project include password reset, user registration, and user role-based access control.**

**Overall, the JDBC login system project is a great way to learn about web application development, database management, and server-side programming using Java.**

**To create a command line login system, the following steps can be taken:**



1.Create a user database: The user database should store user information, such as username, password, and any additional user data. The database can be created using a file or a database management system, such as MySQL or SQLite.

2.Create a login script: The login script should prompt the user to enter their username and password. It should then validate the user's credentials against the user database. If the user's credentials are valid, the script should grant the user access to the system.

3.Implement security measures: To ensure that the login system is secure, the passwords should be stored in an encrypted form. The login script should also be designed to prevent brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts.

4.Create a logout script: The logout script should allow the user to log out of the system. It should also delete any session data associated with the user.

5.Add additional features: Additional features can be added to the login system, such as user registration or password recovery.

**Overall, a command line login system is a simple yet effective way to control access to a system through the command line interface. With proper implementation and security measures, it can be a reliable and secure authentication method.**
